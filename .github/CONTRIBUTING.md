# Contributing to Blnkoo
Blnkoo is supposed to provide developers the basics and allow them to extend it via the API and Custom Events.
This is the reason why blnkoo has no Keyboard or Gestures bindings. I would like to keep it this way. 🙏

Bug fixes are more than welcome!
For any new feature please [submit an issue](https://github.com/aakki16/blnkoo/issues) first before send any pull request.

Thank you & happy contributing! 👊
